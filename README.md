# Roomy

Roomy is a group messaging app that gives online communities tools for autonomous collaboration — designable, gardenable spaces not just for chat, but for cultivating a web of shared understanding together. Roomy is built with [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) and our bespoke event-sourcing sync system, [Leaf](https://github.com/muni-town/leaf). See [this blog post](https://blog.muni.town/brief-history-of-roomy-architectures/) to understand a bit about how this project is developed and where we are now.

## Key Features

**Content fluidity:** In Roomy, every communication artifact can be expanded seamlessly from chat message up to a wiki-page or even standalone channel. [Chatty message gardening](https://blog.muni.town/chatty-community-gardens/)

**Auto-documenting:** Every page, every thread, every post in Roomy is fundamentally a type of *document*. Any single chat message, or a series of them strung together, can at any point be 'transitioned' into the first draft of a Documentation Page.

**Bring your own ID:** Login with Bluesky (default) (soon also Mastodon, GitHub...).  Extend your existing social profile with Roomy. [Digital Homeownership](https://blog.muni.town/digital-homeownership/)

**Bluesky-connected:** Roomy is optionally connected with the Bluesky network of 30M people. Make a Roomy-space for any ATProto (including Bluesky) account.

## Design

Roomy is a spiritual sibling of [Commune](https://github.com/commune-sh). The same core concepts of 'digital gardening applied to group messaging' apply.
