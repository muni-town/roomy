# Roomy

Experimental eventual-p2p group chat, built with [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com/) and [Automerge](https://automerge.org/).

Currently working on producing a functional proof-of-concept. See the
[Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/muni-town/projects/8/views/4).

## Design

Roomy is a spiritual sibling of [Commune](https://github.com/commune-sh). The same core concepts of 'digital gardening applied to group messaging' apply.
