# Code of Conduct

What follows is a *basic* code of conduct. We will upgrade to a more conventional document like the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/) (which we are culturally and morally aligned with) as needed and as our capacity for moderation processing allows.

## Be Kind

- Don't be mean or rude.
- Cultivate a safe and welcoming space for teenagers and grandmothers alike.
- Disagreeing is fine, but keep it to technical arguments. Never attack the person.
- Show empathy. There are 3 interpretations to any message: what we thought, what we said, and what they understand.
- Give the benefit of the doubt. Assume good intentions.
- Personally insulting anyone is prohibited.
- Harassment of any kind is prohibited.
- If another person feels uncomfortable with your remarks, investigate your conduct.
- If a moderator deems your conduct inappropriate, change your conduct.
- We exclude people who fail to be kind.

## Or Else

- Violations of the Code of Conduct will result in 1 warning.
- If the violation is major, a moderator may just ban immediately.
- If a warning has already been given, a moderator will ban the offender.
- There is presently no process for appealing a ban.
- Any violations can be reported to team@roomy.space
