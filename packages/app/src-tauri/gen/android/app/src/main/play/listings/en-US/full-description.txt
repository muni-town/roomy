Roomy is a local-first community platform. Itâ€™s key features include...

<strong>Content fluidity:</strong> In Roomy, every communication artifact can be
 expanded seamlessly from chat message up to a wiki-page or even standalone
channel. <a href="https://blog.muni.town/chatty-community-gardens/">Chatty
message gardening</a>

<strong>Auto-documenting:</strong> Every page, every thread, every post in
Roomy is fundamentally a type of <em>document</em>. Any single chat message, or
a series of them strung together, can at any point be 'transitioned' into the
first draft of a Documentation Page.

<strong>Personally agentic:</strong> Build sovereign communities. You will have
a local copy of your community's data at all times, and so will all your
community members! <a href="https://localfirstweb.dev/">Local-first software.</

<strong>Peer powered:</strong> Make communities that can, if necessary, endure
purely on the shared resources of sufficiently aligned peers in a mutual-
sharing network. <a href="https://blog.muni.town/roomy-deep-dive/">Peer-2-Peer
software</a> <em>(slightly outdated but gist of it remains the same)</em>

<strong>Public-first; privacy-friendly:</strong> Roomy is designed first and
foremost for publicly shared, collaborative content exchange. Private
conversations are carefully supported, but private spaces hosted on our network
needs to go through screenings. If you don't want your private group subjected
to scrutiny, we will soon support self-hosting for full privacy.<a
