# Roomy App Testing Documentation

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the Roomy app using Playwright, with a focus on cross-browser compatibility and worker system functionality.

## Overview

The testing suite is designed to verify that Roomy's complex worker-based architecture functions correctly across different browsers and device configurations. The app uses SharedWorkers (with Worker fallback), SQLite via WebAssembly, and sophisticated lock management for multi-tab coordination.

## Current Status ✅

The Playwright testing rig is **fully functional** and provides comprehensive cross-browser compatibility testing:

- ✅ **Chrome/Chromium**: Fully supported with all features working
- ✅ **Firefox**: Fully supported with all features working
- ✅ **Edge**: Supported (requires manual installation)
- ⚠️ **Safari**: Partial support - basic functionality works but SQLite operations may timeout
- ✅ **Mobile browsers**: Basic functionality tested and working
- ✅ **Responsive design**: Tested across multiple viewport sizes
- ✅ **Worker system**: SharedWorker with Worker fallback working correctly
- ✅ **SQLite**: Database operations working via WebAssembly
- ✅ **Security headers**: COOP/COEP headers properly configured for SharedArrayBuffer

pnpm exec playwright test smoke.spec.ts

# Run all tests headlessly
pnpm test:e2e

# Run with interactive UI (great for development and debugging)
pnpm test:e2e:ui

# Run with browser visible
pnpm test:e2e:headed

# Debug step by step
pnpm test:e2e:debug
```

### Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Run smoke tests (basic functionality - fastest)
pnpm exec playwright test smoke.spec.ts

# Run only worker tests
pnpm exec playwright test workers.spec.ts

# Run only responsive tests
pnpm exec playwright test responsive.spec.ts

# Run only app functionality tests
pnpm exec playwright test app.spec.ts

## Browser Configuration

The tests are configured with special browser flags to support the app's requirements:

### Chrome/Chromium ✅

```javascript
launchOptions: {
  args: [
    "--enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer",
    "--disable-web-security",
    "--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor",
  ];
}
```

### Firefox ✅

```javascript
firefoxUserPrefs: {
  'javascript.options.shared_memory': true,
  'dom.postMessage.sharedArrayBuffer.withCOOP_COEP': false,
}
```

### Safari ⚠️

- Uses default configuration
- Some SQLite operations may timeout due to Safari's restrictions
- Basic functionality still works

### Edge ✅

- Uses Chrome configuration with `channel: 'msedge'`
- Requires manual installation: `pnpm exec playwright install msedge`

## Test Utilities

The `utils/test-helpers.ts` file provides several utilities:

- ✅ `waitForWorkersReady()` - Wait for worker system to initialize
- ✅ `getWorkerStatus()` - Get comprehensive worker status
- ✅ `testWorkerPing()` - Test worker ping with retries
- ✅ `testSqliteOperation()` - Execute SQLite queries safely
- ✅ `checkBrowserCompatibility()` - Verify browser API support
- ✅ `testMultiTabCoordination()` - Test multi-tab scenarios
- ✅ `assertWorkersHealthy()` - Assert proper worker functionality

All utilities are working and tested across browsers.

## Understanding Test Results

### Success Indicators

- All workers initialize within timeout (20s default)
- SQLite operations complete successfully
- Lock coordination works between tabs
- App functions across all viewport sizes
- No critical console errors

### Common Failure Scenarios

**Worker Initialization Timeout:**

- Browser doesn't support required APIs
- COOP/COEP headers not properly set
- Network issues preventing worker loading

**SQLite Lock Issues:**

- Multiple workers trying to acquire exclusive locks
- IndexedDB not available or failing
- Web Locks API not supported

**Cross-Browser Issues:**

- SharedWorker not supported (should fallback to Worker)
- SharedArrayBuffer not available (may impact performance)
- Different browser implementations of APIs

## Debugging

### Development Tips

1. **Start with Smoke Tests:**

   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright test smoke.spec.ts --headed
   ```

   Quick way to verify basic functionality is working.

2. **Use UI Mode:**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e:ui
   ```

   This provides a visual interface to see test execution.

3. **Enable Debug Logging:**
   The tests log worker-related messages to help debug issues.

4. **Check Browser Console:**
   Tests monitor console errors and log them for debugging.

5. **Use Browser DevTools:**

   ```bash
   pnpm test:e2e:debug
   ```

   Pauses execution and opens DevTools.

6. **Focus on Chrome for Development:**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec playwright test --project="Desktop Chrome" --headed
   ```
   Most reliable browser for development and debugging.

### Troubleshooting

**Tests timing out on worker initialization:**

- Check that the dev server is running correctly
- Verify COOP/COEP headers are set
- Ensure all required browser APIs are available

**Multi-tab tests failing:**

- Browser may be blocking multiple tabs
- IndexedDB quota issues
- Lock API implementation differences

**Responsive tests failing:**

- Viewport changes not taking effect
- CSS not loading properly
- Worker performance issues on mobile

## Adding New Tests

### Test Structure

```typescript
import { test, expect } from "@playwright/test";
import { waitForWorkersReady, getWorkerStatus } from "./utils/test-helpers";

test.describe("Your Test Suite", () => {
  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto("/");
  });

  test("should do something", async ({ page }) => {
    await waitForWorkersReady(page);

    const result = await page.evaluate(async () => {
      // Test logic here
      const backend = (window as any).backend;
      return await backend.ping();
    });

    expect(result).toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always wait for workers:** Use `waitForWorkersReady()` before testing functionality
2. **Handle timeouts gracefully:** Worker initialization can take time
3. **Test error scenarios:** Include both success and failure cases
4. **Use proper assertions:** Provide meaningful error messages
5. **Clean up after tests:** Remove any test data created
6. **Consider browser differences:** Test behavior across different browsers

## Performance Considerations

The tests include performance monitoring to ensure:

- Worker initialization completes within reasonable time
- SQLite operations perform consistently
- Multi-tab coordination doesn't degrade performance
- Mobile devices maintain acceptable performance

## Security Testing

The tests verify critical security headers:

- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: credentialless`
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`

These headers are required for SharedArrayBuffer support in modern browsers.

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. **Start with smoke tests** - add to `smoke.spec.ts` for critical functionality
2. Follow existing patterns in the test files
3. Use the provided utility functions
4. Test primarily on Chrome/Firefox (most reliable)
5. Add appropriate error handling
6. Include tests for both success and failure scenarios
7. Update this documentation if needed

### Development Workflow

1. Write new tests in `smoke.spec.ts` for quick iteration
2. Move complex tests to specific spec files once working
3. Test on Chrome first, then Firefox
4. Safari testing is optional (known limitations)

## Success! 🎉
