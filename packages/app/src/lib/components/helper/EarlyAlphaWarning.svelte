          Roomy is in an unstable, early "Alpha" state. This means that it is a
          work-in-progress and is under heavy development. Many things may not
          work as expected and, though we do have backups as a precaution, <strong
            class="text-white">data might not be preserved</strong
          >.
        </p>
        <p>

            >Bluesky</a
          > and we can consider helping you specifically to maintain your data across
          updates to Roomy, until it becomes stable.
