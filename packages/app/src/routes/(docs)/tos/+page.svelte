<h3 id="your-account">Your Account</h3>
<p>
  You must create and log into an account to use some features of the platform.
</p>
<p>
  To create an account, you must provide some information about yourself. If you
  create an account, you agree to provide, at a minimum, a valid e-mail address
  (NOTE: Change pending), and to keep that address up-to-date. You may close
  your account at any time by e-mailing team@roomy.space
</p>
<p>
  You agree to be responsible for all action taken using your account, whether
  authorized by you or not, until you either close your account or notify the
  company that your account has been compromised. You agree to notify the
  company immediately if you suspect your account has been compromised. You
  agree to select a secure password for your account, and keep it secret.
</p>
<h3 id="your-content">Your Content</h3>
<p>
  Nothing in these terms gives the company any ownership rights in intellectual
  property that you share with the platform, such as your account information,
  posts, or other content you submit to the platform. Nothing in these terms
  gives you any ownership rights in the company’s intellectual property, either.
</p>
<p>
  Between you and the company, you remain solely responsible for content you
  submit to the platform. You agree not to wrongly imply that content you submit
  to the platform is sponsored or approved by the company. These terms do not
  obligate the company to store, maintain, or provide copies of content you
  submit.
</p>
<p>
  Content you submit to the platform belongs to you, and you decide what
  permission to give others for it. But at a minimum, you license the company to
  provide content that you submit to the platform to other users of the
  platform, and to process it, according to these terms. That special license
  allows the company to copy, publish, and analyze content you submit to the
  platform.
</p>
<p>
  When content you submit is removed from the platform, whether by you or by the
  company, the company’s special license ends when the last copy disappears from
  the company’s backups, caches, and other systems. Other licenses you apply to
  content you submit, such as Creative Commons licenses, may continue after your
  content is removed. Those licenses may give others, or the company itself, the
  right to share your content through the platform again.
</p>
<p>
  Others who receive content you submit to the platform may violate the terms on
  which you license your content. You agree that the company will not be liable
  to you for those violations or their consequences.
</p>
<h3 id="your-responsibility">Your Responsibility</h3>
<p>
  You agree to indemnify the company from legal claims by others related to your
  breach of these terms, or breach of these terms by others using your account
  on the platform. Both you and the company agree to notify the other side of
  any legal claims for which you might have to indemnify the company as soon as
  possible. If the company fails to notify you of a legal claim promptly, you
  won’t have to indemnify the company for damages that you could have defended
  against or mitigated with prompt notice. You agree to allow the company to
  control investigation, defense, and settlement of legal claims for which you
  would have to indemnify the company, and to cooperate with those efforts. The
  company agrees not to agree to any settlement that admits fault for you or
  imposes obligations on you without your prior agreement.
</p>
<h3 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h3>
<p>
  You accept all risk of using the platform and content on the platform. As far
  as the law allows, the company and its suppliers provide the platform as is,
  without any warranty whatsoever.

  The platform may hyperlink to and integrate platforms and services run by
  others. The company does not make any warranty about services run by others,

  other terms between you and the one running the service.
</p>

  used, get your permission to use it, or pay you. You agree not to submit
  feedback or suggestions that you believe might be confidential or proprietary,
  to you or others.
</p>
<h3 id="termination">Termination</h3>

  any time. When our agreement ends, your permission to use the platform also
  ends.

  Terms.
</p>
<h3 id="disputes">Disputes</h3>
<p>
  Norwegian law will govern any dispute related to these terms or your use of
  the platform.
</p>
<p>
  You and the company agree to seek injunctions related to these terms only in
  federal court in Oslo, Norway. Neither you nor the company will object to
  jurisdiction, platform, or venue in those courts.

  Consumer Related Disputes in the context of Norwegian jurisdiction.)
</p>
<p>
  Any arbitration award will include costs of the arbitration, reasonable
  attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for witnesses. You and the company may
  enter arbitration awards in any court with jurisdiction.
</p>
<h3 id="general-terms">General Terms</h3>
<p>
  If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be
  changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the
  minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision
  should be removed.
</p>
<p>
  You may not assign your agreement with the company. The company may assign
  your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains
  control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company
  related to the platform. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no
  legal effect.
</p>
<p>
  Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any
  breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
  These terms are all the terms of agreement between you and the company about
  use of the platform. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about
  your use of the platform, written or not.
