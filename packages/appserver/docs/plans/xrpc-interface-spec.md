# XRPC Interface Specification

**Date:** 2026-04-13
**Status:** Spec
**Parent doc:** `appserver-architecture.md`

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| WebSocket model | Single multiplexed connection | Browser WS limit (~6 per domain) makes per-procedure subscriptions unviable |
| Client cache | TanStack Query (not TanStack DB) | Server sends denormalized results; IVM adds no value. TanStack Query is production-grade, runes-compatible, supports `invalidateQueries()` and `setQueryData()` |
| Join ownership | Server-side | Appserver owns all SQL joins. Client never joins data. API returns fully assembled objects. |
| Data freshness | WS is sole freshness authority | All queries use `staleTime: Infinity`. HTTP re-fetches only on WS invalidation signals. |
| WS message categories | Message diffs + invalidation signals | Diffs applied via `setQueryData()` (hot path, no HTTP round-trip). Invalidation signals trigger `invalidateQueries()` → HTTP re-fetch. Server sends multiple `#invalidate` frames for events affecting multiple queries — no batch frame type needed. |
| Endpoint granularity | Broad queries over narrow | Space metadata includes sidebar tree. Room metadata includes recent threads. Fewer round-trips, less client-side merging. |

### Frontend Data Flow Changes

Merging sidebar into `space.getMetadata` and linked rooms into `room.getMetadata` changes how the client consumes this data:

- **Before (LiveQuery):** `#metadataQuery` and `#sidebarQuery` were separate reactive queries in `SpaceState`, merged client-side.
- **After:** Single `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` query returns everything. The `SpaceState` layer is replaced by a single TanStack Query whose result is consumed directly by the sidebar component.
- **Room page:** Instead of a separate `LinkedRoomsList` query, the room metadata query includes `recentThreads`. The linked rooms panel reads from the same query cache.

## Endpoint Summary

### HTTP Queries (GET, authenticated via PDS proxy)

| NSID | Source LiveQuery | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` | #1 | All joined or admin-of spaces with metadata, caller capabilities, per-space unreadCount |
| `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` | #2, #3, #4 | Space name, avatar, description, join policy, caller capabilities, sidebar tree with per-channel access |
| `space.roomy.space.getThreads` | #7 | Threads for space board/index view |
| `space.roomy.space.getRoles` | (new) | Roles, their room permissions, and assigned members |
| `space.roomy.space.getMembers` | (new) | Space members with profile data |
| `space.roomy.space.getInvites` | (new) | Active invite tokens (caller-scoped: creator's own, or all if admin) |
| `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` | #6, #8, #10 | Room name, kind, spaceId, defaultAccess, caller capabilities, lastRead, unreadCount, recent threads |
| `space.roomy.room.getMessages` | #5 | Paginated messages for a room (read-access enforced) |
| `space.roomy.room.getThreads` | #11 | All threads within a channel (read-access enforced) |
| `space.roomy.message.getMessage` | #14 | Single message by ID (read-access enforced) |

### HTTP Procedures (POST, authenticated via PDS proxy)

| NSID | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `space.roomy.auth.getConnectionTicket` | Obtain WS pre-auth ticket |
| `space.roomy.room.updateSeen` | Mark messages in a room as read |

### WebSocket Subscription (single connection)

| NSID | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `space.roomy.sync.subscribe` | Multiplexed real-time sync: message diffs + invalidation signals |

**Total: 10 queries, 2 procedures, 1 subscription = 13 XRPC methods.**

Eliminated from initial scope:
- `space.roomy.space.getSidebar` — merged into `getMetadata`
- `space.roomy.room.getLinkedRooms` — merged into `room.getMetadata` as `recentThreads`
- `space.roomy.page.getContent` / `space.roomy.page.getHistory` — page features disabled in client
- `space.roomy.space.getCalendarLink` / `space.roomy.space.getCalendarEvents` — low priority
- EntityName inline query (#9) — parent queries include names directly

---

## Authorization Model

The appserver mirrors the authorization model already implemented in the SDK (`packages/sdk/src/modules/index.ts`). Two key facts:

1. **Admin and membership are orthogonal.** A caller may be an admin without being a member, or a member without being an admin. Every authorization decision is the **union** of (a) admin-edge presence and (b) role-derived permissions. The persistent `admin` edge survives leave/rejoin and is the canonical admin signal; the legacy `member` edge `can` payload is read for backward compatibility only.

2. **Per-room access is the union of three signals:**
   - Caller has the `admin` edge on the space, **or**
   - The room's `default_access` (or its parent channel's `default_access`, for threads — inherited via `link` edge) permits the operation, **or**
   - The caller has a role assigned via `member_roles` whose `role_rooms` entry for that room grants the required permission level.

   `default_access` ∈ `readwrite | read | none` and defaults to `readwrite`. Threads do not have their own `default_access` — they inherit from the channel reached via their `link` edge.

3. **Per-endpoint requirements:**

   | Endpoint | Caller must be |
   |---|---|
   | `getSpaces` | Authenticated; returns spaces where caller is member OR admin |
   | `getMetadata` (space) | Member OR admin of the space |
   | `getThreads` (space) | Member OR admin of the space |
   | `getRoles` | Member OR admin of the space |
   | `getMembers` | Member OR admin of the space |
   | `getInvites` | Admin (sees all) OR creator (sees own only) |
   | `getMetadata` (room) | Has read access to the room (admin OR default_access ≠ none OR matching role grant) |
   | `getMessages` / `getThreads` (room) / `getMessage` | Has read access to the room |
   | `getConnectionTicket` | Authenticated |
   | `updateSeen` | Has read access to the room (admin OR default_access ≠ none OR matching role grant) |
   | `sync.subscribe` topics | Per-topic: must have read access to the room/space the topic refers to |

   Endpoints that fail authorization return XRPC `AuthRequired` (HTTP 401) for missing identity or `Forbidden` (HTTP 403) for insufficient permissions.

4. **Caller-scoped fields.** Several response objects include caller-derived capability fields (`isAdmin`, `canRead`, `canWrite`). These are computed per-request from the caller's DID and are not cacheable across users. The `nsid + params` query key already isolates caches per browser session.

---

## HTTP Procedure Endpoints

All HTTP procedures are authenticated via PDS proxy with inter-service JWT (see `authentication.md`).

### `space.roomy.room.updateSeen`

Notify the appserver that the caller has read messages in a room up to a given message. The appserver is the **source of truth** for read positions — this replaces the previous flow where clients sent `space.roomy.state.markRead.v0` state events to the Leaf server.

**Background:** In the Leaf/SDK model, the space module's `stateMaterializer` handled read receipts by storing `(user_did, room_id, last_read)` in a Leaf-side `state.reads` table, where `last_read` was set to the room's integer `message_count` at the time of the event. Unread count was derived as `message_count - last_read`. This approach required the appserver to actively poll Leaf for state — an impractical data access pattern. Moving read-position ownership to the appserver eliminates this polling requirement.

**Authorization:** Caller must have read access to the room (same gate as `room.getMetadata`): admin, or `default_access ≠ none`, or a matching role grant. Returns `Forbidden` (403) if the caller has no read access.

**Input:**

```typescript
{
  roomId: string;              // required — the room to mark as seen
  seenUpTo?: string;           // optional — message entity ID (ULID) to use as
                               // the high-water mark. Omit to mark all current
                               // messages as seen.
}
```

**Response:** `200 OK` (empty body)

**Behavior:**
1. Verify caller has read access to the room → 403 if not
2. Resolve the read watermark and compute remaining unread:
   - If `seenUpTo` is provided: look up the `sort_idx` for that message entity. Returns 400 if the message doesn't exist or isn't in this room. Remaining `unread_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities WHERE room = ? AND sort_idx > ?)` — one-time computation at write time.
   - If `seenUpTo` is omitted: `seen_up_to = MAX(sort_idx)` for the room, `unread_count = 0` — marks everything as read.
3. Upsert into the `read_positions` table:
   ```sql
   insert into read_positions (user_did, room_id, seen_up_to, unread_count, updated_at)
   values (?, ?, ?, ?, unixepoch() * 1000)
   on conflict(user_did, room_id) do update set
     seen_up_to = excluded.seen_up_to,
     unread_count = excluded.unread_count,
     updated_at = excluded.updated_at;
   ```
4. Push `#invalidate` signals scoped to the caller:
   - `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` for this room
   - `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` for the room's parent space
   - `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` (total unread counts change)

**New database table:**

```sql
create table if not exists read_positions (
  user_did    text not null,
  room_id     text not null,
  seen_up_to  text not null,   -- sort_idx of the last-read message entity
  unread_count integer not null default 0,
  updated_at  integer not null default (unixepoch() * 1000),
  primary key (user_did, room_id)
) strict;
```

This table **replaces** `comp_last_read` (which was per-room, not per-user). The `comp_last_read` table can be dropped once `read_positions` is live.

**Write-time aggregation (read-heavy optimization):**

Roomy is read-heavy — `getSpaces`, `getMetadata`, etc. are called far more often than messages are sent. Unread counts must be pre-computed on writes, not computed on reads. This mirrors the SDK's approach where the space module's materializer increments a counter on each `createMessage`.

1. **On `createMessage` materialization** (in `applyBundle.ts`): instead of incrementing the old per-room `comp_last_read.unread_count`, increment `read_positions.unread_count` for every user who has a row for this room:

   ```sql
   update read_positions
     set unread_count = unread_count + 1,
         updated_at = (unixepoch() * 1000)
   where room_id = ?;
   ```

   This is a single-row update per user per room — bounded by membership, not by message volume. Users without a `read_positions` row (e.g. not yet initialized) are unaffected; they'll get a row on join or first `updateSeen` call.

2. **On `updateSeen` call**: compute and store the remaining unread count, then zero it:
   - If `seenUpTo` is omitted: `unread_count = 0` (mark all read)
   - If `seenUpTo` is provided: `unread_count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities WHERE room = ? AND sort_idx > ?)` — this is a one-time computation at write time, acceptable since `updateSeen` is called infrequently (once per room navigation)

3. **On read queries** (`getSpaces`, `getMetadata`, `room.getMetadata`): return `read_positions.unread_count` directly. No `COUNT(*)`, no joins against `entities`. This is O(1) per room.

4. **If no `read_positions` row exists** for a `(user_did, room_id)` pair, the user has never marked read and has not been initialized. Return `unreadCount = 0` for now — the row will be created on join or first `updateSeen`.

**Join handling:** When a user joins a space (`joinSpace.v0`), the SDK's materializer pre-marks all existing channels as read. The appserver should perform the same initialization — insert `read_positions` rows for all visible rooms in the space with `seen_up_to` set to the current max `sort_idx` for each room and `unread_count = 0`. This prevents existing messages from appearing as unread on join.

**Backfill note:** During backfill, `opts.isBackfill = true` — the existing code already skips the `comp_last_read` increment for backfilled messages. The same guard should apply to the `read_positions` increment. Backfilled messages are historical and should not inflate unread counts.

**Invalidation signals:** `#invalidate` targeting the caller for:
- `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` (this room)
- `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` (parent space — sidebar unread badges)
- `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` (space list unread totals)

These are the same targets as the existing `handleMarkRead` in `inferSignals.ts`, but triggered by the XRPC handler instead of a Leaf state event.

**Migration note:** The client currently calls `peer.sendStateEvent(streamId, { $type: "space.roomy.state.markRead.v0", room })`. The thin-client migration replaces this with a direct call to `POST /xrpc/space.roomy.room.updateSeen`. The Leaf state event path is no longer needed for read receipts.

## HTTP Query Endpoints

All HTTP queries are authenticated via PDS proxy with inter-service JWT (see `authentication.md`).

### `space.roomy.space.getSpaces`

Returns all spaces where the caller is a member OR an admin (the two are orthogonal — see Authorization Model). Includes per-space metadata and caller capabilities.

**Params:** *(none)*

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  spaces: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string | null;
    avatar: string | null;
    description: string | null;
    unreadCount: number;      // total unread messages across rooms the caller can read
    isMember: boolean;        // caller has 'member' edge on this space
    isAdmin: boolean;         // caller has 'admin' edge on this space
    roleIds: string[];        // role IDs assigned to the caller in this space (may be empty)
  }>;
}
```

`isMember` and `isAdmin` are independent — both, either, or neither may be true. `unreadCount` is computed only over rooms the caller has read access to (admin override, default_access, or matching role grant).

**Invalidation signals:** `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` when:
- Caller joins/leaves a space (member edge added/removed)
- Caller's admin edge added/removed
- Caller's role assignments change (`addMemberRole`/`removeMemberRole`)
- Unread counts change in any reachable room
- A role's room permissions change in a way that adds/removes reachable rooms (recompute `unreadCount`)

---

### `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`

Returns space metadata **and the complete sidebar tree** in a single response. The server handles orphan detection (channels not pinned to any category) that was previously done client-side.

**Params:** `spaceId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  name: string | null;
  avatar: string | null;
  description: string | null;
  joinPolicy: {
    allowPublicJoin: boolean;     // default true
    allowMemberInvites: boolean;  // default false
  };
  isMember: boolean;       // caller has 'member' edge
  isAdmin: boolean;        // caller has 'admin' edge (orthogonal to membership)
  sidebar: {
    categories: Array<{
      id: string;           // category entity ID
      name: string;
      position: number;
      channels: Array<{
        id: string;         // channel entity ID
        name: string;
        defaultAccess: "readwrite" | "read" | "none";
        canRead: boolean;   // caller-scoped — admin OR default_access≠none OR role grant
        canWrite: boolean;  // caller-scoped — admin OR default_access=readwrite OR role 'readwrite'
        unreadCount: number;
        lastRead: string | null;  // ISO timestamp
      }>;
    }>;
    orphans: Array<{        // channels not in any category
      id: string;
      name: string;
      defaultAccess: "readwrite" | "read" | "none";
      canRead: boolean;
      canWrite: boolean;
      unreadCount: number;
      lastRead: string | null;
    }>;
  };
}
```

The sidebar is filtered server-side: channels the caller cannot read (no admin, `default_access = none`, no matching role grant) are omitted. `canRead` is therefore always true on returned entries; it is included for completeness and forward-compatibility (future hidden-but-listable channels). `canWrite` distinguishes read-only from read-write access.

**Invalidation signals:** `#invalidate` targeting this endpoint on:
- Sidebar config changes
- Channel creation, deletion, rename
- Channel `default_access` changes (`updateRoom.v0`)
- Message activity (unread count changes)
- Space name/avatar/description changes
- Join policy changes (`updateSpaceInfo.v0` `allowPublicJoin`/`allowMemberInvites`)
- Caller's admin edge added/removed
- Caller's role assignments change
- Any role's `role_rooms` entry changes for this space (sidebar visibility may shift)

**Frontend note:** This replaces the separate `#metadataQuery` and `#sidebarQuery` in `SpaceState`. The sidebar component reads `data.sidebar` directly from this query's result.

---

### `space.roomy.space.getThreads`

Returns all threads in a space for the board/index view, with latest activity metadata.

**Params:** `spaceId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  threads: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    channel: string | null;     // parent channel ID
    activity: {
      latestTimestamp: string;   // ISO timestamp of latest message
      latestMembers: Array<{    // up to 3 unique recent participants
        did: string;
        name: string;
        avatar: string | null;
      }>;
    };
  }>;
}
```

---

### `space.roomy.space.getRoles`

Returns all roles defined in a space, with their per-room permissions and assigned members. Drives the roles settings page and the role-permission picker in `EditRoomModal`.

**Params:** `spaceId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  roles: Array<{
    id: string;                  // role ULID (the createRole event ID)
    name: string | null;
    avatar: string | null;
    description: string | null;
    rooms: Array<{
      roomId: string;
      permission: "read" | "readwrite";
    }>;
    memberDids: string[];        // DIDs of members assigned to this role
  }>;
}
```

Soft-deleted roles (`roles.deleted = 1`) are omitted.

**Invalidation signals:** Role create/update/delete, addMemberRole/removeMemberRole, setRoleRoomPermission — any of these targeting this `spaceId`.

---

### `space.roomy.space.getMembers`

Returns all members of a space with profile data. Drives `RoleModal`'s member picker and `UserTypeahead`.

**Params:** `spaceId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  members: Array<{
    did: string;
    handle: string | null;
    name: string | null;
    avatar: string | null;
    isAdmin: boolean;             // has 'admin' edge (orthogonal to membership)
    roleIds: string[];            // role IDs assigned to this member in this space
  }>;
  // Admins who are NOT members (admin ⊥ membership) are returned separately
  // so callers can distinguish "member with admin role" from "external admin".
  externalAdmins: Array<{
    did: string;
    handle: string | null;
    name: string | null;
    avatar: string | null;
  }>;
}
```

**Invalidation signals:** Member join/leave (member edge add/remove), admin edge add/remove, role assignment changes for any member, profile updates for any member of this space.

---

### `space.roomy.space.getInvites`

Returns active invite tokens. Caller-scoped: admins see all invites for the space; non-admin members see only invites they themselves created.

**Params:** `spaceId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  invites: Array<{
    token: string;
    createdBy: string;     // DID of the creator
    eventUlid: string;     // ULID of the createInvite event
  }>;
}
```

Returns `Forbidden` if caller is neither a member nor an admin. Returns `Forbidden` for non-admin members when `allow_member_invites = 0` (they cannot have created any invites in that case, so the response would be empty anyway, but the check makes intent explicit).

**Invalidation signals:** `createInvite` / `revokeInvite` events targeting this `spaceId`. Caller's admin edge changes (admins see a different set than non-admins).

---

### `space.roomy.room.getMetadata`

Returns room metadata **with recently active threads** included. The `recentThreads` field replaces the separate `getLinkedRooms` query — it provides enough data for the linked rooms panel in the room view.

**Params:** `roomId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  name: string;
  kind: string;              // "channel" | "thread" | "page"
  spaceId: string;
  defaultAccess: "readwrite" | "read" | "none";  // for threads: inherited from parent channel
  canRead: boolean;          // caller-scoped
  canWrite: boolean;         // caller-scoped
  lastRead: string | null;   // ISO timestamp
  unreadCount: number;
  recentThreads: Array<{     // recently active threads (linked or child threads)
    id: string;
    name: string;
    canRead: boolean;
    canWrite: boolean;
    unreadCount: number;
    lastRead: string | null;
  }>;
}
```

For threads, `defaultAccess` is resolved server-side by following the `link` edge to the parent channel. The endpoint returns `Forbidden` if the caller has no read access (admin, default_access ≠ none, and role grants all checked).

**Invalidation signals:** `#invalidate` targeting this endpoint on:
- Room name/kind changes
- Room `default_access` changes (channel directly, or for threads: parent channel)
- Unread count changes
- Thread activity in this room
- Caller's admin edge or role assignments change
- A role's permission for this room changes (`setRoleRoomPermission`)

**Frontend note:** The `LinkedRoomsList` component reads `data.recentThreads` instead of issuing a separate query. For the full thread list in a channel, use `space.roomy.room.getThreads`.

---

### `space.roomy.room.getMessages`

Paginated message history for a room. Returns fully denormalized message objects with all joins resolved server-side. This is the most complex query (source LiveQuery #5 joins 10+ tables).

**Params:**
- `roomId` (required)
- `limit` (optional, default 50, max 100)
- `cursor` (optional) — message entity ID for cursor-based pagination (messages older than this ID)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  messages: Array<{
    id: string;
    content: string;
    authorDid: string;
    authorName: string;
    authorAvatar: string | null;
    timestamp: string;           // ISO timestamp
    replyTo: string | null;      // parent message ID
    forwardedFrom: {
      name: string;
      roomId: string;
    } | null;
    reactions: Array<{
      emoji: string;
      dids: string[];            // DIDs of users who reacted
    }>;
    media: Array<{
      url: string;
      type: string;              // MIME type
      alt: string | null;
    }>;
    tags: string[];
  }>;
  cursor: string | null;         // next page cursor, null if no more
}
```

- Cursor is a message entity ID, not a timestamp, to handle concurrent messages correctly.
- Includes forwarded messages (follows `forward` edge to get original content).

---

### `space.roomy.room.getThreads`

All threads within a specific channel.

**Params:** `roomId` (required)

**Response:**

```typescript
{
  threads: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    canonicalParent: string | null;
    activity: {
      latestTimestamp: string;
      latestMembers: Array<{
        did: string;
        name: string;
        avatar: string | null;
      }>;
    };
  }>;
}
```

---

### `space.roomy.message.getMessage`

Single message by ID.

**Params:** `messageId` (required)

**Response:** Same shape as a single message object from `space.roomy.room.getMessages`.

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  content: string;
  authorDid: string;
  authorName: string;
  authorAvatar: string | null;
  timestamp: string;
  replyTo: string | null;
  forwardedFrom: { name: string; roomId: string } | null;
  reactions: Array<{ emoji: string; dids: string[] }>;
  media: Array<{ url: string; type: string; alt: string | null }>;
  tags: string[];
}
```

**Cache optimisation:** TanStack Query caches are isolated per queryKey — no automatic cross-query cache sharing. Use `initialData` to check the room messages cache first:

```typescript
function createMessageQuery(messageId: string, roomId: string) {
  return createQuery({
    queryKey: ["space.roomy.message.getMessage", { messageId }],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const res = await fetchViaPds(
        `/xrpc/space.roomy.message.getMessage?messageId=${messageId}`,
      );
      return res.json();
    },
    initialData: () => {
      const roomMessages = queryClient.getQueryData(
        ["space.roomy.room.getMessages", { roomId }],
      );
      return roomMessages?.find((m) => m.id === messageId);
    },
  });
}
```

If the message is in the room cache, `initialData` resolves immediately with no network request. If not found, the `queryFn` fetches from the server. The caller must pass `roomId` for cache lookup — always available for reply previews in ChatArea; falls back to network for other contexts.

## WebSocket Subscription: `space.roomy.sync.subscribe`

### Overview

A single multiplexed WebSocket connection carries all real-time data. The client subscribes/unsubscribes to topics; the server pushes two categories of messages:

1. **Message diffs** (`#messageDiff`) — applied directly to TanStack Query cache via `setQueryData()`. No HTTP round-trip.
2. **Invalidation signals** (`#invalidate`) — trigger `invalidateQueries()` → HTTP re-fetch. Server sends multiple frames for events affecting multiple queries.

### Connection Lifecycle

```text
1. Client obtains ticket via POST /xrpc/space.roomy.auth.getConnectionTicket
2. Client opens WebSocket:
   wss://appserver.roomy.chat/xrpc/space.roomy.sync.subscribe?ticket=<ticket>
3. Server validates ticket, accepts connection
4. Client sends { "type": "cursor", "seq": N } if reconnecting (0 for first connect)
5. Client sends sub messages for active topics
6. Server replays missed diffs (if cursor is within buffer) + sends invalidation signals
7. Server pushes frames for subscribed topics going forward
8. On disconnect: client reconnects with new ticket + last received seq
```

### Client → Server Messages

JSON-encoded text frames:

```typescript
// Subscribe to a topic
{ "type": "sub", "topic": "space", "id": "<spaceId>" }
{ "type": "sub", "topic": "room", "id": "<roomId>" }

// Unsubscribe from a topic
{ "type": "unsub", "topic": "room", "id": "<roomId>" }

// Reconnection cursor (sent once, immediately after connect)
{ "type": "cursor", "seq": 12345 }
```

Topic semantics:
- `space:<id>` — sidebar/metadata changes, membership changes, thread creation
- `room:<id>` — message diffs, room metadata changes, reaction changes, thread activity

Subscribing to a space does **not** automatically subscribe to all rooms in it. Room subscriptions are explicit (the client subscribes to the active room).

### Server → Client Messages

CBOR-encoded binary frames using ATProto wire format (two consecutive CBOR values: header + body).

| `t` (event type) | `op` | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#messageDiff` | 1 | Message add/update/remove for a subscribed room |
| `#invalidate` | 1 | Signal that a query's data is stale |
| `#error` | -1 | Error frame (closes connection) |

#### `#messageDiff`

Applied directly to TanStack Query cache. No HTTP round-trip.

```typescript
// Header: { op: 1, t: "#messageDiff" }
// Body:
{
  roomId: string;
  seq: number;
  ops: Array<{
    op: "add" | "update" | "remove";
    key: string;          // message entity ID
    message?: {           // present for add/update, absent for remove
      id: string;
      content: string;
      authorDid: string;
      authorName: string;
      authorAvatar: string | null;
      timestamp: string;
      replyTo: string | null;
      forwardedFrom: { name: string; roomId: string } | null;
      reactions: Array<{ emoji: string; dids: string[] }>;
      media: Array<{ url: string; type: string; alt: string | null }>;
      tags: string[];
    };
  }>;
}
```

#### `#invalidate`

Triggers `invalidateQueries()` for the specified endpoint.

```typescript
// Header: { op: 1, t: "#invalidate" }
// Body:
{
  nsid: string;                      // e.g. "space.roomy.space.getMetadata"
  params: Record<string, string>;    // e.g. { spaceId: "..." }
}
```

The client maps this directly to:

```typescript
queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [nsid, params] });
```

#### `#error`

```typescript
// Header: { op: -1, t: "#error" }
// Body:
{
  error: string;     // e.g. "TokenExpired", "InternalServerError"
  message: string;
}
```

### Reconnection

The appserver maintains a bounded in-memory event log (ring buffer, ~10k entries) with a global monotonically increasing sequence number. This is not the Leaf stream sequence — the appserver may filter, transform, or derive events during materialisation, so it maintains its own ordering.

1. Client reconnects with a new ticket
2. Client sends `{ "type": "cursor", "seq": N }` immediately after connecting (where N is the last received seq)
3. Client sends `sub` messages for its active topics
4. If N is within the buffer: server replays missed `#messageDiff` frames where `seq > N` AND topic matches the client's current subscriptions, then sends `#invalidate` for all subscribed non-message queries (conservative: cheaper than tracking per-query staleness)
5. If N is outside the buffer (or 0): server sends `#invalidate` for all subscribed queries (client re-fetches everything via HTTP)

No persistence across restarts — clients receive full invalidation on appserver restart, same as the "cursor too old" path.

The `seq` field appears in `#messageDiff` frames. The client tracks the highest seq it has received and sends it on reconnect.

## Invalidation Signal Routing

### Event → Frame Mapping

| Leaf event | Affected topic(s) | Server action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New message in room X | `room:X` | `#messageDiff` (add) to all connections subscribed to `room:X` |
| Message edit in room X | `room:X` | `#messageDiff` (update) |
| Message delete in room X | `room:X` | `#messageDiff` (remove) |
| Reaction add/remove in room X | `room:X` | `#messageDiff` (update — reaction field changed) |
| Room name/kind change | `space:<parentSpace>` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` |
| New thread in channel X (space Y) | `space:Y`, `room:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`, `space.roomy.space.getThreads`, and `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` |
| Space name/avatar/description change | `space:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` |
| Sidebar config change | `space:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` (sidebar is part of this response) |
| User join/leave space X | `space:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getSpaces`, `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`, `space.roomy.space.getThreads`, `space.roomy.space.getMembers` |
| Admin edge add/remove on space X | `space:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getSpaces`, `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`, `space.roomy.space.getMembers`, and (for the affected user only) all room metadata and sidebar visibility — admins see everything |
| Unread count change (new message increments `comp_last_read.unread_count`) | `room:X`, `space:<parent>` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.room.getMetadata`, `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`, and `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` |
| `updateSeen` procedure called by user U for room X | (no Leaf event — direct appserver state) | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` (room X), `space.roomy.space.getMetadata`, `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` — scoped to user U only |
| Thread activity in room X | `room:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` (recentThreads) |
| Channel `default_access` change in space Y | `space:Y`, `room:<channel>` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` (sidebar visibility may change), `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` for the channel and all its threads |
| Role create/update/delete in space Y | `space:Y` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getRoles`. If permissions change in a way that affects sidebar/room visibility for any subscriber, also `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` and `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` for affected rooms |
| addMemberRole / removeMemberRole in space Y | `space:Y` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getRoles`, `space.roomy.space.getMembers`. For the affected user only: `space.roomy.space.getSpaces`, `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` (sidebar), and `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` for any rooms whose access changes |
| setRoleRoomPermission in space Y for room X | `space:Y`, `room:X` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getRoles`, `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` (sidebar visibility), and `space.roomy.room.getMetadata` for room X. For users assigned to that role: also `space.roomy.space.getSpaces` (unread/reachability may shift) |
| createInvite / revokeInvite in space Y | `space:Y` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getInvites` |
| Space join policy change (allowPublicJoin / allowMemberInvites) | `space:Y` | `#invalidate` for `space.roomy.space.getMetadata` |

### Server-side Pub/Sub

The appserver maintains an in-memory routing table:

```text
connection_id → { did, Set<topic> }    // identity + topics this WS connection is subscribed to
topic          → Set<connection_id>     // which connections care about this topic
```

When a Leaf event arrives:
1. Determine affected topics (e.g. message in room X → topic `room:X`)
2. Look up subscribed connections for that topic
3. Generate frame(s) and send to matching connections

Memory cost is bounded by: `(active connections) × (avg subscriptions per connection)`. Typical session: 1 space + 1 room = 2 topics.

**Per-user invalidation.** Some invalidations (admin edge changes, role assignment changes) only affect a specific user — sending `#invalidate` to every subscriber of `space:Y` would cause needless re-fetches. The connection's authenticated `did` is recorded at WS handshake time; routing for these events filters by `did` against the topic's subscribers. The table above marks rows with "for the affected user only" where this filtering applies.

**Caller-scoped responses and cache safety.** Several endpoints return caller-scoped fields (`isAdmin`, `canRead`, `canWrite`, filtered sidebar). The TanStack Query cache is per-browser-session and keyed by `[nsid, params]`, so there is no risk of one user seeing another's cached response. The appserver must, however, never return a cached response across different authenticated callers — handlers compute caller-scoped fields per request.

## Client Integration with TanStack Query

### Query Client Setup

```typescript
import { QueryClient } from "@tanstack/svelte-query";

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: Infinity,            // WS is sole freshness authority
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,    // no automatic refetching
      refetchOnReconnect: false,      // WS handles reconnection data
    },
  },
});
```

### Query Key Convention

Every query uses `[nsid, params]` as its key. This maps directly to the `#invalidate` frame format.

```typescript
["space.roomy.space.getMetadata", { spaceId: "..." }]
["space.roomy.room.getMessages", { roomId: "..." }]
["space.roomy.room.getMetadata", { roomId: "..." }]
```

### Query Definitions

```typescript
import { createQuery } from "@tanstack/svelte-query";

function createSpaceMetadataQuery(spaceId: string) {
  return createQuery({
    queryKey: ["space.roomy.space.getMetadata", { spaceId }],
    queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, params] }) => {
      const url = `/xrpc/space.roomy.space.getMetadata?spaceId=${params.spaceId}`;
      const res = await fetchViaPds(url);
      return res.json();
    },
  });
}

function createRoomMetadataQuery(roomId: string) {
  return createQuery({
    queryKey: ["space.roomy.room.getMetadata", { roomId }],
    queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, params] }) => {
      const url = `/xrpc/space.roomy.room.getMetadata?roomId=${params.roomId}`;
      const res = await fetchViaPds(url);
      return res.json();
    },
  });
}

function createMessagesQuery(roomId: string) {
  return createQuery({
    queryKey: ["space.roomy.room.getMessages", { roomId }],
    queryFn: async ({ queryKey: [, params] }) => {
      const url = `/xrpc/space.roomy.room.getMessages?roomId=${params.roomId}&limit=50`;
      const res = await fetchViaPds(url);
      const data = await res.json();
      return data.messages;
    },
  });
}
```

### WS Message Handler

```typescript
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { header, body } = decodeCborFrame(event.data);

  switch (header.t) {
    case "#messageDiff": {
      queryClient.setQueryData(
        ["space.roomy.room.getMessages", { roomId: body.roomId }],
        (oldMessages = []) => applyMessageDiff(oldMessages, body.ops),
      );
      break;
    }

    case "#invalidate": {
      queryClient.invalidateQueries({
        queryKey: [body.nsid, body.params],
      });
      break;
    }
  }
};
```

### Diff Application

```typescript
function applyMessageDiff(
  messages: Message[],
  ops: DiffOp[],
): Message[] {
  const map = new Map(messages.map((m) => [m.id, m]));
  for (const op of ops) {
    if (op.op === "add" && op.message) {
      map.set(op.key, op.message);
    } else if (op.op === "update" && op.message) {
      map.set(op.key, { ...map.get(op.key), ...op.message });
    } else if (op.op === "remove") {
      map.delete(op.key);
    }
  }
  // NOTE: This re-sorts the entire array on every diff — O(n log n) per
  // incoming message. For rooms with many messages, consider binary insert
  // on "add" and in-place update on "update" for O(log n) typical perf.
  // Low priority — candidate for the Rust rewrite.
  return [...map.values()].sort(
    (a, b) => new Date(a.timestamp).getTime() - new Date(b.timestamp).getTime(),
  );
}
```

## Lexicons

```text
lexicons/
  space/
    roomy/
      auth/
        getConnectionTicket.json   ← already exists
      space/
        getSpaces.json
        getMetadata.json
        getThreads.json
        getRoles.json
        getMembers.json
        getInvites.json
      room/

        getMetadata.json
        getMessages.json
        getThreads.json
      message/
        getMessage.json
      sync/
        subscribe.json
```

Lexicons follow ATProto JSON schema format. The `space.roomy.sync.subscribe` lexicon defines the subscription NSID but does not prescribe individual message types — those are appserver-internal protocol details documented here.

## Future: Notifications

Topic subscriptions (`sub`/`unsub`) are viewport-scoped — they control what the server sends over the WebSocket for real-time UI updates. They are intentionally not the mechanism for notification delivery.

Notifications are a separate concern with different properties:

- **Viewport subscriptions** are ephemeral (tied to navigation state), connection-scoped, and drive UI rendering. Unsubscribing means "stop sending me frames for this topic."
- **Notification interest** is persistent (survives navigation and disconnection), user-scoped, and drives alerts. A user can have notifications enabled for rooms they're not currently viewing.

When the appserver processes a new message, it will consult both systems:

1. **Routing table** (viewport subscriptions) — send `#messageDiff` to connections subscribed to that room's topic
2. **Notification preferences** (persistent, per-room/space config) — for users interested in this room who are NOT viewport-subscribed:
   - If they have an active WS connection → send a lightweight notification frame (badge count, mention summary)
   - If they have no active WS connection → deliver via push notification (Web Push API)

The appserver is the natural place for this routing decision because it knows both the user's notification preferences and their current connection state.

This design means:
- No changes needed to the current `sub`/`unsub` protocol
- Notification preferences will be managed via a separate HTTP endpoint (not yet specified)
- A new WS frame type (e.g. `#notify`) will carry in-app notification data, distinct from `#messageDiff`/`#invalidate`
- Push notification delivery is a separate subsystem that shares the same preference store
