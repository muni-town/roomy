//! The supervisor: N spaces in one process.
//!
//! A process owns a set of spaces and gives each one a blocking actor: a
//! dedicated thread with its own write connection, its own lease, and its own
//! cancellation token. Nothing is shared between actors but the configuration and
//! the health snapshot, which is why one space's slowdown cannot stall another's
//! materialisation.
//!
//! What the supervisor does that a bare loop cannot:
//!
//!  * **Ownership is explicit.** Actors start from the spaces the caller names;
//!    a space nobody named is not materialised, whatever the log holds.
//!  * **A process can derive its spaces instead.** [`Supervisor::discover`] asks
//!    the feed which streams it holds and starts an actor for each one this
//!    process may run and is not running. It never stops an actor, and it opens
//!    no space database for a stream with nothing to apply.
//!  * **Stopping is per space.** `stop_space` cancels one actor, waits for it,
//!    and lets it release its lease and flush its signals. `stop` does that for
//!    every actor, in parallel.
//!  * **An idle space is unloaded.** With `idle_unload` set, an actor that has
//!    applied nothing for that long exits and drops its database handle, so the
//!    open-set is bounded by what is actually busy. `rearm` starts it again.
//!  * **A failing space waits, and says what failed.** A step that returns an
//!    error retries under an exponential backoff, so one space that cannot make
//!    progress costs neither a core nor a log flood; the warning names the
//!    space, the cursor it is stuck at, and the error.
//!
//! The supervisor binds no socket and reads no environment; the binary that
//! hosts it does both.
